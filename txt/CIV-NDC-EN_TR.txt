After a decade of politico-military crisis that has led to a deep social divide, Côte d'Ivoire has set itself the goal of becoming an emerging country by 2020. To stimulate and coordinate the many facets of its development, the Côte d'Ivoire has returned to its planning tradition.
The country has also returned to rapid growth (in the order of 8% per year), in a context of peace. Populations are also beginning to take advantage of the renewed dynamism, thanks to efforts to redistribute and correct the inequalities achieved in the different sectors.
The 2016-2020 NDP currently being finalized to consolidate this trajectory towards emergence and industrialization. This planning is part of a longer-term vision. The National Prospective Study "Ivory Coast 2040" is also being finalized.
The country 's national development strategy combined with high population growth would lead to a substantial increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, Côte d'Ivoire is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
To meet these challenges, in 2012, Côte d'Ivoire set up the National Climate Change Program (NCCP) to coordinate, propose and promote measures and strategies in the fight against climate change. A National Strategy for Combating Climate Change 2015-2020 was adopted at the end of 2014.
Through this Nationally Determined Planned Contribution (INDC), Ivory Coast, the United States seeks to reduce its carbon footprint by favoring mitigation options with high "co-benefits" (Section 2: Mitigation); strengthen the country's resilience to climate change (Section 3: Adaptation); bring coherence to its sectoral policies and strengthen its mechanism and implementation tools to facilitate the achievement of these objectives (Section 4); and mobilize for this purpose, including funding, both national and international (Section 5).
2. Mitigation
2.1. Contribution of Ivory Coast
While taking into account the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Ivory Coast, as African economies face the challenge of development to improve the quality of life of its population. The growing need for this development, which includes increasing agricultural production, agro-industrial processing, the fight against deforestation and the continuation or even the acceleration of the supply of modern energy to all inhabitants, does not undermine the country's political will to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. However, Côte d'Ivoire needs to be supported to pursue the path of sustainable development, respectful of the environment and concerned about the challenges of climate change.
The INDCs of Côte d'Ivoire are therefore a contribution based on the development of the sectoral development strategies providing for the support of the technical and financial partners.



Type of contribution 
Combination of objectives and mitigation actions




National long-term goal on GHG emissions
Low Carbon Scenario (2030)
Reduction of GHG emissions compared to emissions in the target year (2030) in a baseline scenario (Business As Usual or BAU).


Target year
2030


Base year
2012


Cumulative reduction of emissions by 2030
Low Carbon Scenario (2030)
-28%


Sector objectives
Low Carbon Scenario (2030)
Composition of the electricity mix: 26% of coal, 32% of combined cycle natural gas, 26% of hydropower and 16% of other renewable energy sources (Renewable energy sources), ie a total of 42% of renewable energy in the electricity mix in 2030.
Intensification and mechanization of agriculture and animal production.
Reduction of GHG emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation.
Sustainable management and recovery of waste.


Equity of the Contribution
Côte d'Ivoire has low GHG emissions with only 0.81 tCO 2 / cap (excluding forestry)
The necessary development of Côte d'Ivoire (+ 8.4% GDP growth by 2030) would be accompanied by an increase in emissions to 1,17 tCO 2 / inhab (+ 44.4%) in 2030 .


Ambition of the Contribution
Côte d'Ivoire is committed to:
Increase to 42% the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix (including large hydropower).
Implement the strategy to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in addition to sustainable forest management and ambitious reforestation policies (REDD +).
The 28% drop in emissions from the low-carbon scenario compared to a baseline scenario (BAU) represents a significant effort for a country with a GDP per capita of 148th worldwide (2014, on a PPP basis).


Short-lived atmospheric pollutants (PCDV / SLCP)
Côte d'Ivoire is committed to reducing short-lived climate pollutants that have an impact on climate in addition to long-lasting GHGs. To this end, the country will develop by 2018 a national action plan to reduce PCDV / SLCP whose contributions to global warming are clearly established by UNEP in its 2011 report.

Responsible: SCICC Secretariat



5. Means of implementation 


Funding 
Côte d'Ivoire intends to mobilize the following sources to finance the mitigation and adaptation actions of these INDCs:


Private Finance 
Côte d'Ivoire intends to mobilize international or domestic private financing (equity and loans) as much as possible for the co-financing of relevant INDC actions, particularly actions that can generate an acceptable financial return for the sector. private. To this end, Côte d'Ivoire will strive to increase the bank rate, stimulate the formation of savings, and strengthen domestic financial markets and banking systems, as well as the attractiveness of Côte d'Ivoire for foreign investment (investment climate)


National budget 
Côte d'Ivoire will play its part in financing the actions of these INDCs, which are part of the state budget. This state effort can take the form either of direct budgetary expenditure or transit through specific funds financed from the state budget.


Donors / PTF 
Côte d'Ivoire will seek support from donors and TFPs (grants, loans and technical assistance) to finance the actions of these INDCs. Access to sovereign loans from Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) will be crucial.


Green Climate Fund 
Côte d'Ivoire is considering whether to set up a national entity accredited to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It is already in the process of preparing for the operationalization of the GCF at the national level (Readiness Program)


Carbon markets 
Côte d'Ivoire supports the inclusion of international carbon markets such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in a post-2020 climate agreement and proposes that such an instrument, coupled with an appropriate accounting regime (MRV) , can be used to help finance some investments in low carbon and climate resilient infrastructure. Côte d'Ivoire considers that some of the low-carbon development options contained in these INDCs, or additional actions, could be financed in whole or in part by the international transfer of carbon assets taking into account the integrity considerations of the environment and transparency.


Other economic instruments 
The opportunity to deploy tools to generate a price signal on the social cost of carbon (market or carbon tax) and thus to internalize the carbon externality will be explored


First five-year period 
A first five-year tranche of Actions to be financed is in preparation and will be presented during the 4th quarter of 2015. It will be consistent with, and reflected in, the 2016-2020 NDP.


Capacity Building 
Mitigation
At all levels: link between development, natural disaster risk reduction, energy and climate change
For decision-makers: the interests of integrating energy and climate thinking into all sectoral policies
For operators: implementation of low-carbon development, for example: 
Farmers: Agricultural practices allowing sustainable intensification of production; management methods and valorisation of agricultural residues. 
Entrepreneurs: The keys to success in developing a renewable energy project in rural areas; valorization of products resulting from a sustainable agriculture.


Adaptation
The capacity building of actors (especially women, farmers, etc.) focuses on new technical routes in the context of intensified and sustainable production methods.
Inform, educate and communicate on climate risks 
Strengthen the system of observation of meteorological phenomena through synoptic stations
Set up a system of early warning multi-risks
Strengthen national and local capacities for disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness in case of disasters
Environmental Information Management System 
Create an air quality management center responsible for the following activities:
Ensure the watch on the ambient air pollution
Evaluate pollutant releases at the source
Inform the public about the state of air quality
Provide state reports on air pollution for decision-making
Promote the establishment of an air quality observatory
Strengthen regional and international cooperation in the field of air quality
Train a person responsible for this observatory / air quality management center.
Create a dynamic network of observation and monitoring of the coastline nationwide to identify areas at risk of coastal erosion and examination of one or more indicators reflecting the relationship climate / coastal erosion



Transfers and technology development, R & D 
Development of partnerships between companies and research centers on the development of low-carbon solutions.
Improved access to tools (eg timing of crop cycles in the rainy season)
